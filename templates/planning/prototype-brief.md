# Prototype Brief: {{Name}}

## 🚀 Executive Summary

**One-sentence description**: {{What you're building and why - keep it to ONE sentence}}

## 💡 The Hypothesis

### 📋 Problem Statement
{{What problem are we trying to solve? Who has this problem? How painful is it?}}

### 🎯 Solution Hypothesis
{{What do we think will solve this problem? What's our proposed solution?}}

### ❓ Key Questions to Answer
1. **Technical Feasibility**: {{Can we build this with our current tech stack?}}
2. **User Value**: {{Will users actually want/use this?}}
3. **Business Viability**: {{Is this worth the investment to build fully?}}
4. **{{Additional question}}**: {{Specific to your prototype}}

## 📅 Timeline & Scope

### Time Box
- **Start Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}
- **End Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}} ⏰ HARD STOP
- **Duration**: {{X}} days
- **Demo Date**: {{YYYY-MM-DD}}

### Success Looks Like
At the end of this prototype, we should have:

- [ ] {{Measurable outcome 1 - e.g., "Working demo that shows core flow"}}
- [ ] {{Measurable outcome 2 - e.g., "Feedback from 10 target users"}}
- [ ] {{Measurable outcome 3 - e.g., "Data to make go/no-go decision"}}
- [ ] {{Measurable outcome 4}}

## 🎯 Scope Definition

### ✅ MUST Have (Core Features Only)

These are non-negotiable for the prototype:

1. **{{Feature 1}}**
   - {{Brief description}}
   - Why critical: {{Reason}}

2. **{{Feature 2}}**
   - {{Brief description}}
   - Why critical: {{Reason}}

3. **{{Feature 3}}**
   - {{Brief description}}
   - Why critical: {{Reason}}

### ❌ WON'T Have (Explicitly Out of Scope)

These are things we're consciously NOT building:

- ❌ **Authentication/Authorization** - Hardcode single user
- ❌ **Error Handling** - Happy path only
- ❌ **Edge Cases** - Main flow only
- ❌ **Performance Optimization** - Functional > fast
- ❌ **Scalability** - Single user sufficient
- ❌ **Production Deployment** - Local/dev only
- ❌ **Comprehensive Testing** - Smoke tests only
- ❌ **Beautiful UI** - Functional UI is enough
- ❌ **{{Your specific exclusion}}**
- ❌ **{{Your specific exclusion}}**

### 🔄 COULD Have (If Time Permits)

Only add these if core features are done AND there's extra time:

- 🔄 {{Nice to have 1}}
- 🔄 {{Nice to have 2}}

## 👥 Team

### Core Team
- **Lead/Decision Maker**: @{{agent}} - Final calls on scope and direction
- **Builder(s)**: @{{agent}}, @{{agent}} - Write the code
- **Advisor(s)**: @{{agent}} - Consulted as needed

### User Testers
- {{User 1 name}} - {{User type/persona}}
- {{User 2 name}} - {{User type/persona}}
- {{User 3 name}} - {{User type/persona}}

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Why These Choices
We're using tech that's **fast to build with**, NOT necessarily "best practice":

**Backend**: {{Technology}} - Because {{reason - speed/familiarity/etc}}
**Frontend**: {{Technology}} - Because {{reason}}
**Database**: {{Technology}} - Because {{reason}}
**Deployment**: {{Platform}} - Because {{reason}}

### Acceptable Shortcuts ✅

For this prototype, the following are ENCOURAGED:

- ✅ Hardcoded configuration values
- ✅ Mock/fake data
- ✅ Using third-party services (no-code tools if faster)
- ✅ Copy-pasting template/starter code
- ✅ Skipping tests initially
- ✅ No CI/CD
- ✅ Manual deployment
- ✅ Single development environment only
- ✅ Code quality: "good enough" not "perfect"

## 📊 Validation Plan

### User Testing Approach
- **Who**: {{Description of target users}}
- **When**: Days {{X-Y}} of the prototype
- **How**: {{Method: demo session / survey / analytics / observation}}
- **Duration**: {{X}} minutes per session

### Key Questions for Users
1. {{Question designed to test your hypothesis}}
2. {{Question about usability}}
3. {{Question about value proposition}}
4. {{Open-ended question}}

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How to Measure | Decision Impact |
|--------|--------|----------------|-----------------|
| User Interest | ≥7/10 avg rating | Post-demo survey | Primary go/no-go |
| Task Completion | >80% complete task | Observation | Usability indicator |
| Technical Feasibility | Working demo | Does it work? | Go/no-go |
| {{Custom metric}} | {{Target}} | {{Method}} | {{Impact}} |

## 🚦 Decision Criteria

At the end of the prototype, we'll make one of these decisions:

### 🟢 GO (Proceed to Full Development)
**Criteria**:
- ✅ Users rate interest ≥7/10
- ✅ Technical feasibility proven (demo works)
- ✅ Clear path to production identified
- ✅ ROI calculation justifies investment
- ✅ {{Your specific criterion}}

**Next Steps if GO**:
1. {{Next step 1}}
2. {{Next step 2}}
3. {{Estimated timeline for full build}}

### 🔄 PIVOT (Change Direction)
**Criteria**:
- 🔄 Some value demonstrated but approach needs changes
- 🔄 Technical approach was wrong, but problem is real
- 🔄 User needs are different than expected
- 🔄 {{Your specific criterion}}

**Next Steps if PIVOT**:
1. {{What to change}}
2. {{New hypothesis to test}}
3. {{Timeline for next iteration}}

### 🔴 NO-GO (Stop Here)
**Criteria**:
- ❌ Users rate interest <5/10
- ❌ Technical blockers discovered (can't be built)
- ❌ ROI doesn't justify cost
- ❌ Better alternatives exist
- ❌ {{Your specific criterion}}

**Next Steps if NO-GO**:
1. Document learnings
2. Archive prototype
3. Move on to next priority
