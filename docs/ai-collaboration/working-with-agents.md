## How to Work with Agents

### 1. Choose the Right Agent
Match the agent's expertise to your task.

### 2. Provide Context
- What you're building
- Tech stack being used
- Existing patterns in project
- Constraints and requirements

### 3. Be Specific
- Clear task description
- Expected output
- Success criteria
- Examples if helpful

### 4. Iterate
- Review generated code
- Ask for explanations
- Request improvements
- Test thoroughly

## Example Interaction

```
You: "I need to create a user registration endpoint"

Backend Agent needs:
- Framework (Express, FastAPI, etc.)
- Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Validation requirements
- Authentication method
- Error handling preferences

Better request:
"Create a user registration endpoint using Express.js and PostgreSQL.
Validate email format and password strength (min 8 chars).
Hash passwords with bcrypt.
Return JWT token on success.
Handle duplicate email errors with 409 status."
```

## Best Practices

- Start with clear requirements
- Share relevant code/patterns
- Ask for explanations
- Verify understanding
- Test thoroughly
- Iterate as needed
